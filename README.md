# NVIM Configurations

nvim configurations made using my personal preferrences, I tend to keep vim simple.

## Dependencies

### neovim
I'm using neovim which because I was having trouble with mac installed vim that ultisnips is incompatible with my vim version. 
I know I should've uninstall default vim and reinstall using brew, but I'm just too lazy to go to mac recovery mode and uninstall vim, installing nvim is the simplest way to go for me.
Anyway, you can install neovim by referring this following docs:
```
https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md
```

### Vim Plug
I'm using vim plug as plugins manager, that can be installed by referring this following docs:
```
https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/blob/master/README.md
```
